# A Short and Practical Encyclopedia of Python (and other things) for Data Science

## Why this repo exists

I had not been a programmer before I started a bootcamp in Data Science, so I had to (and still have to) learn a lot of new info every day.

It quickly turned out that I cannot rely on my memory alone. My brain seems to have its own opinion on what is worth remembering and what is not, and it is also suprisingly efficient in getting rid of whatever falls into the second category.

I soon got tired of searching for the n-th time for "how to drop a column in a pandas dataframe", so I began writing down examples of code with explanations for future reference.

## What you will find here

This file consists of examples of code with explanations.

The examples of code are most often adapted from sites like [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [Geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and random internet blogs, as well as from different excercises and official documentation. If an example of code is here, it means that I have tried it myself and it worked for me (no copypasting without checking).[1]

I tried to give explicit names to variables where I thought that it would make the code easier to understand.

In many cases, I added comments explaining syntax, data types that are being manipulated, and generally what the code does. As I intend to use this file myself, I tried to make these explanations as simple as possible. I think they may be useful for a beginner like me (but probably less interesting for a more advanced learner).

I also included images where they help to understand what is going on.

I intend to go on adding and correcting this repo as I continue my learning, and I hope it will be useful for others, too.
